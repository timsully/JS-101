// Given a string, return a new string that replaces every occurrence of the word "important" with "urgent":
let advice =
  "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur.";

advice.replace("important", "urgent");
// Note that if the string contains two or more occurrences of important, this code only replaces the first.
