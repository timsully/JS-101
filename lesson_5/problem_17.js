/*
A UUID is a type of identifier often used to uniquely identify items, even when some of those items were created on a different server or by a different application. That is, without any synchronization, two or more computer systems can create new items and label them with a UUID with no significant risk of stepping on each other's toes. It accomplishes this feat through massive randomization. The number of possible UUID values is approximately 3.4 X 10E38, which is a huge number. The chance of a conflict is vanishingly small with such a large number of possible values.

Each UUID consists of 32 hexadecimal characters (the digits 0-9 and the letters a-f) represented as a string. The value is typically broken into 5 sections in an 8-4-4-4-12 pattern, e.g., 'f65c57f6-a6aa-17a8-faa1-a67f2dc9fa91'.

Write a function that takes no parameters and returns a UUID.

  let characters = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'];

    for (let index = 1; index <= section; index++) {

      uuid += characters[randomIndex];
    }

    if (sectionIndex < sections.length - 1) {
      uuid += "-";
    }
